The Aqara Cube is a smart device that can be used to control your home. It has six sides, each with a different sensor that can detect motion, gestures, and sounds.

The Aqara Cube can be used to control a wide range of smart devices, such as lights, thermostats, doors, and windows. It can also be used to create automations, such as turning on the lights when you enter a room or turning off the thermostat when you leave home.

Our handmade version will take care of the same features and in this document we will show you how to do it:
